# Pre-commit Hooks
For developers, please install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
sudo apt install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

And do install the [ruff vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff).

The `.vscode/settings.json` is configured aligning with the pre-commit hooks. Whenever you save the file, it will be formatted automatically.
