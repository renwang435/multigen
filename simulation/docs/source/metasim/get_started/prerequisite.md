# Prerequisites

## Use All Simulators Supported by MetaSim

To develop with the full capability of MetaSim, it is recommended to [install with Docker](./docker.md) on Ubuntu. The recommended setup is as follows:

### System Requirements

| Component        | Ideal           | Minimum         |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **CPU**          | Intel Core i9   | Intel Core i7   |
| **Cores**        | 32 cores        | 4 cores         |
| **GPU**          | RTX 4090        | RTX 3070 / 4060 |
| **VRAM**         | 24GB            | 8GB             |
| **RAM**          | 64GB            | 32GB            |
| **Free Storage** | 500GB SSD       | 50GB SSD        |

### Environment Setup

| Component           | Recommended Setup (tested) | Alternative Setup (not fully tested) |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Operating System** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS          | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS                 |
| **NVIDIA Driver**    | 535                       | 550, 570                         |
| **CUDA Toolkit**     | 11.8                      | 12.*                             |

- Check your NVIDIA driver version with `nvidia-smi`.
- Check your CUDA toolkit version with `nvcc --version`.


## Light-weight Installation

If you only want to try MetaSim, you can [directly install](./installation.rst) the specific simulator backends as you need.

You may choose one or more of the following simulators, according to your operating system.

| OS      | IsaacLab v1.4 | IsaacLab v2 | IsaacGym | MuJoCo | SAPIEN v2 | SAPIEN v3 | Genesis | PyBullet |
