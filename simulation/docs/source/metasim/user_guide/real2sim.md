# Real2Sim

The general idea of Real2Sim is to reconstruct the static scene and generate scene-aligned digital asset for robotic manipulation.

The google drive link here include the scene aligned reconstructed asset from a monocular video.

The instruction and toolset to generate this asset will be released soon.
