# Objects in RoboVerse

RoboVerse supports a wide variety of **USD**-formatted assets that contribute to building immersive worlds. These assets are categorized for easy identification and usage. While not all assets are utilized in our demonstration tasks, they are available for you to incorporate into your own custom tasks. Below is an overview of the different types of assets available:

- [Objects in RoboVerse](#objects-in-roboverse)
  - [Objects](#objects)
  - [Articulated Objects](#articulated-objects)
  - [Garments/Deformable Objects](#garmentsdeformable-objects)


## Objects

Objects are simple items without any joint or connection relationships. RoboVerse has curated a collection of these objects from publicly available datasets. Below are some examples:

| ManiSkill YCB  | Objects (78)                      |

## Articulated Objects

Articulated objects are designed with features that can be grasped, such as handles or knobs. The positioning, color, and geometry of these features vary.
