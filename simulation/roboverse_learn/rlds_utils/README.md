# RLDS Dataset Conversion

This utils folder demonstrates how to convert RoboVerse data into RLDS format for mainstream VLA pre-training. If you just want to convert the rendered RoboVerse dataset to RLDS format, please refer to the `roboverse` folder. All you need to do is create a soft link of `demo` to the `roboverse` folder and run `tfds build --overwrite` in the `roboverse` folder after verifying your installation of the conversion environment. The transformed rlds dataset will be stored in `~/tensorflow_datasets/roboverse_dataset`.

## Installation

First create a conda environment using the provided environment.yml file (use `environment_ubuntu.yml` or `environment_macos.yml` depending on the operating system you're using):
```
conda env create -f environment_ubuntu.yml
```

Then activate the environment using:
```
conda activate rlds_env
```

If you want to manually create an environment, the key packages to install are `tensorflow`,
`tensorflow_datasets`, `tensorflow_hub`, `apache_beam`, `matplotlib`, `plotly` and `wandb`.

## Converting RoboVerse Data to RLDS

Now we can modify the provided example to convert RoboVerse data. Follow the steps below:

1. **Rename Dataset**: Change the name of the dataset folder from `example_dataset` to the name of your dataset (e.g. robo_net_v2),
also change the name of `example_dataset_dataset_builder.py` by replacing `example_dataset` with your dataset's name (e.g. robo_net_v2_dataset_builder.py)
and change the class name `ExampleDataset` in the same file to match your dataset's name, using camel case instead of underlines (e.g. RoboNetV2). Here, we only need to modify corresponding code in the `roboverse` folder.

1. **Modify Features**: Modify the data fields you plan to store in the dataset. You can find them in the `_info()` method
of the `ExampleDataset` class. Please add **all** data fields your raw data contains, i.e. please add additional features for
additional cameras, audio, tactile features etc. If your type of feature is not demonstrated in the example (e.g. audio),
you can find a list of all supported feature types [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features?hl=en#classes).
You can store step-wise info like camera images, actions etc in `'steps'` and episode-wise info like `collector_id` in `episode_metadata`.
Please don't remove any of the existing features in the example (except for `wrist_image` and `state`), since they are required for RLDS compliance.
Please add detailed documentation what each feature consists of (e.g. what are the dimensions of the action space etc.).
Note that we store `language_instruction` in every step even though it is episode-wide information for easier downstream usage (if your dataset
does not define language instructions, you can fill in a dummy string like `pick up something`). Please directly refer to the `RoboVerseDataset` class defined in `/roboverse/roboverse_dataset_builder.py` for our usage.

1. **Modify Dataset Splits**: The function `_split_generator()` determines the splits of the generated dataset (e.g. training, validation etc.).
If your dataset defines a train vs validation split, please provide the corresponding information to `_generate_examples()`, e.g.
by pointing to the corresponding folders (like in the example) or file IDs etc. If your dataset does not define splits,
remove the `val` split and only include the `train` split. You can then remove all arguments to `_generate_examples()`.

1. **Modify Dataset Conversion Code**: Next, modify the function `_generate_examples()`. Here, your own raw data should be
loaded, filled into the episode steps and then yielded as a packaged example. Note that the value of the first return argument,
`episode_path` in the example, is only used as a sample ID in the dataset and can be set to any value that is connected to the
particular stored episode, or any other random value. Just ensure to avoid using the same ID twice.

1. **Provide Dataset Description**: Next, add a bibtex citation for your dataset in `CITATIONS.bib` and add a short description
of your dataset in `README.md` inside the dataset folder. You can also provide a link to the dataset website and please add a
few example trajectory images from the dataset for visualization.

1. **Add Appropriate License**: Please add an appropriate license to the repository.
Most common is the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license --
you can copy it from [here](https://github.com/teamdigitale/licenses/blob/master/CC-BY-4.0).

That's it! You're all set to run dataset conversion. Inside the dataset directory, run:
```
tfds build --overwrite
```
The command line output should finish with a summary of the generated dataset (including size and number of samples).
Please verify that this output looks as expected and that you can find the generated `tfrecord` files in `~/tensorflow_datasets/<name_of_your_dataset>`.


### Parallelizing Data Processing
By default, dataset conversion is single-threaded. If you are parsing a large dataset, you can use parallel processing.
For this, replace the last two lines of `_generate_examples()` with the commented-out `beam` commands. This will use
Apache Beam to parallelize data processing. Before starting the processing, you need to install your dataset package
by filling in the name of your dataset into `setup.py` and running `pip install -e .`

Then, make sure that no GPUs are used during data processing (`export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=`) and run:
```
tfds build --overwrite --beam_pipeline_options="direct_running_mode=multi_processing,direct_num_workers=10"
```
You can specify the desired number of workers with the `direct_num_workers` argument.

## Visualize Converted Dataset
To verify that the data is converted correctly, please run the data visualization script from the base directory:
```
python3 visualize_dataset.py <name_of_your_dataset>
```
This will display a few random episodes from the dataset with language commands and visualize action and state histograms per dimension.
Note, if you are running on a headless server you can modify `WANDB_ENTITY` at the top of `visualize_dataset.py` and
add your own WandB entity -- then the script will log all visualizations to WandB.

## Add Transform for Target Spec

For X-embodiment training we are using specific inputs / outputs for the model: input is a single RGB camera, output
is an 8-dimensional action, consisting of end-effector position and orientation, gripper open/close and a episode termination
action.

The final step in adding your dataset to the training mix is to provide a transform function, that transforms a step
from your original dataset above to the required training spec. Please follow the two simple steps below:

1. **Modify Step Transform**: Modify the function `transform_step()` in `example_transform/transform.py`. The function
takes in a step from your dataset above and is supposed to map it to the desired output spec. The file contains a detailed
description of the desired output spec.

2. **Test Transform**: We provide a script to verify that the resulting __transformed__ dataset outputs match the desired
output spec. Please run the following command: `python3 test_dataset_transform.py <name_of_your_dataset>`
